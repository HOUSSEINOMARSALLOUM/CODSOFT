Welcome to the CODSOFT Calculator project! This simple calculator application is designed to perform basic mathematical operations in a user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The backbone of the project, providing the structure and semantics for the calculator's web page.

- **CSS:** Used for styling and theming the calculator, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

- **JavaScript:** Empowers the calculator with dynamic functionality, allowing users to perform calculations in real-time.

## File Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file that structures the calculator's webpage. It includes meta tags for better SEO and social media sharing.

- **cssCalc.css:** The stylesheet that defines the visual appearance of the calculator. It uses CSS Grid for layout and custom styles for buttons and themes.

- **scriptCalc.js:** The JavaScript file responsible for the calculator's logic. It handles user input, performs calculations, and updates the display.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to launch the calculator.

2. Click on the number buttons to input values.

3. Use the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) for mathematical operations.

4. The "DEL" button clears the screen, and the "=" button calculates the result.

## Why These Technologies?
